# Optical-character-recognition-OCR-

Description:

This project focuses on developing an Optical Character Recognition (OCR) system tailored for financial documents. The goal is to accurately extract text content from diverse financial images, such as receipts, invoices, and statements. Leveraging advanced image processing techniques and machine learning algorithms, the OCR engine will be trained to recognize and interpret financial text, enhancing the efficiency of document digitization and data extraction processes.

Key Components:

1. **Image Preprocessing:**
   - Implement robust preprocessing techniques to enhance the quality and clarity of financial images, including resizing, noise reduction, and contrast adjustments.
2. **OCR Algorithm:**
   - Utilize state-of-the-art OCR algorithms, possibly incorporating deep learning models, to accurately recognize text within financial images.
3. **Financial Terminology Recognition:**
   - Customize the OCR system to specifically identify and interpret financial terminology, such as amounts, dates, transaction details, and currency symbols.
